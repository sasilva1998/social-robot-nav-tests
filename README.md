# Social Robot Navigation Tests

This repository aims to hold the tests and results done for different social robot navigation methods, here is a description of the packages:

- `pepper_social_nav_tests:` used to run and test social robot navigation approaches in simulation using the pepper robot and `pedsim_ros`.
- `real_pepper_social_nav_tests:` used to run and test social robot navigation approaches in real life experiments. So far for people tracking pozyx localization system is used and additional sensors like RGBD cameras and LIDARs.
